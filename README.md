# Langton-s-Ant-with-jQuery
A demonstration of Langton's Ant using jQuery.
My representation of Langton's Ant, built with jQuery, exists on a 100x100 grid. The ant runs for 3000 cycles, which in this particular case is just enough to see the emergent order of a so-called "highway" that always forms, seemingly inevitably, for any given setup. This "highway" is a 104-move pattern that forms a 45 degree pillar.
